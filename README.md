# Multi-omics identification of metastasis-specific EMT genes and their characteristics in gastric cancer

In this study, we conducted whole transcriptome sequencing analysis of 66 paired primary and metastatic gastric cancer (GC) tumors obtained from 14 patients. We identified 122 metastasis-specific epithelial-mesenchymal transition (msEMT) genes that showed distinct expression patterns depending on the route of metastasis. High expression of these genes in primary tumors was associated with CDH1 mutations, genomic stability, and poor prognosis. Furthermore, msEMT gene expression in primary tumors demonstrated predictive value for peritoneal or ovarian recurrence. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that the msEMT genes were mainly expressed in fibroblasts, suggesting their origin from the tumor microenvironment. This study provides insights into the complex interplay between GC cells and the tumor microenvironment, highlighting the clinical significance of msEMT genes in predicting metastatic behavior and informing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
